All you have to use it is to just run the script with the following command:

```bash
./minimal-linux.sh
```

The command will download and build the minimal Linux. After finished, you can use it as if you are interacting with a native installation of a Linux based system. To close it, use the command:

```bash
poweroff -f
```
